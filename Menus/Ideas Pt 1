This all is meant to essentially replicate the way the ace attorney collections work but way worse and also just have a title screen cus everyone else does it
In Episodes 1 the title can change if you go for the "Assinine Barson" routes, and more importantly, loses the name all together when Ire dies in the main route
Technically speaking there should be a guy pointing on the art but I didn't bother for now, I'll fix it later I guess
There'll be a song for the title screen now, a song for it in Episode 2 onwards and maybe even something further
there'll be a gallery, but it will noticably not include a good chunk of things that SHOULD be in the game. There's also the accolades, which are episode dependant.
Getting all of them could grant you a secret ending teaser thing I guess
